# AutoTDD - Automated Test, Documentation, and Security Analysis for Delphi with GitHub Actions and ChatGPT

AutoTDD is an automated tool that uses GitHub Actions to generate unit tests, documentation, or security analyses for Delphi code. When specific tags are added to the Delphi code, a Go script is executed to request ChatGPT to generate tests, comments, or security assessments. The result is automatically inserted within the specified tags.
